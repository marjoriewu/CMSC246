Assignment 2 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)
  The first four assignments are relatively simple program that help us strengthen
  concepts that have occurred in readings. However, the last two assignments are
  more complex and requires a lot of thinking.
2. What was hard about this assignment?
  The workload is fairly reasonable, but since I am taking 380 and 246 concurrently
  the workload was overwhelming with these two combined.
3. What would you like to know more about?
  I would like to learn more about how to use pointers and dynamically allocate
  arrays in c. That way it may be easier for me to implement the last question.
4. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)
  About 8 hours.
