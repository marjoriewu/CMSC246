Assignment 1 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)
This assignment requires a bit of time for me to think and check certain points on
the textbook. Meanwhile, I spent almost half an hour trying to debug a printing issue
(when operation gets printed the second time I can't input characters: it was like
"Enter an operation:Enter a number:"). Even though I solved the problem by putting
a space before scanf, I still did not why it was causing this problem. Oh now I know why!
didn’t read professor’s last line of note…

2. What was hard about this assignment?
The last question was a bit complicated required me to refer back to textbook for
guidance while the first three questions are intuitive, but I needed a bit time to
think of the algorithms since it has been a while since last time I wrote programs.

3. What would you like to know more about?
I would like to know more detail about how c cooperates with computer and run programs
on it.

4. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)
approximately 3 hours.
